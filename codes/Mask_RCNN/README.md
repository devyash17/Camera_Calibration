# Mask R-CNN for Object Detection and Segmentation

This is an implementation of [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 backbone.

The repository includes:
* Source code of Mask R-CNN built on FPN and ResNet101.
* Training code for MS COCO
* Pre-trained weights for MS COCO
* Jupyter notebooks to visualize the detection pipeline at every step
* ParallelModel class for multi-GPU training
* Evaluation on MS COCO metrics (AP)


# Getting Started
* [demo.ipynb](samples/demo.ipynb) Is the easiest way to start. It shows an example of using a model pre-trained on MS COCO to segment objects in your own images.
It includes code to run object detection and instance segmentation on arbitrary images.

* ([model.py](mrcnn/model.py), [utils.py](mrcnn/utils.py), [config.py](mrcnn/config.py)): These files contain the main Mask RCNN implementation. 


* [inspect_data.ipynb](samples/inspect_data.ipynb). This notebook visualizes the different pre-processing steps
to prepare the training data.

* [inspect_model.ipynb](samples/inspect_model.ipynb) This notebook goes in depth into the steps performed to detect and segment objects. It provides visualizations of every step of the pipeline.



# Step by Step Detection
To help with debugging and understanding the model, there are 2 notebooks 
([inspect_data.ipynb](samples/inspect_data.ipynb), [inspect_model.ipynb](samples/inspect_model.ipynb),
that provide a lot of visualizations and allow running the model step by step to inspect the output at each point. Here are a few examples:



## 1. Anchor sorting and filtering
Visualizes every step of the first stage Region Proposal Network and displays positive and negative anchors along with anchor box refinement.

## 2. Bounding Box Refinement
This is an example of final detection boxes (dotted lines) and the refinement applied to them (solid lines) in the second stage.

## 3. Mask Generation
Examples of generated masks. These then get scaled and placed on the image in the right location.

## 4. Weight Histograms
Another useful debugging tool is to inspect the weight histograms. These are included in the inspect_weights.ipynb notebook.

## 5. Composing the different pieces into a final result

# Training on MS COCO
Pre-trained weights for MS-COCO are available. We can
use those weights as a starting point to train our own variation on the network.
Training and evaluation code is in `samples/coco.py`. We can import this
module in Jupyter notebook (see the provided notebooks for examples) or we
can run it directly from the command line as such:

```
# Train a new model starting from pre-trained COCO weights
python3 samples/coco.py train --dataset=/path/to/coco/ --model=coco

# Train a new model starting from ImageNet weights
python3 samples/coco.py train --dataset=/path/to/coco/ --model=imagenet

# Continue training a model that you had trained earlier
python3 samples/coco.py train --dataset=/path/to/coco/ --model=/path/to/weights.h5

# Continue training the last model you trained. This will find
# the last trained weights in the model directory.
python3 samples/coco.py train --dataset=/path/to/coco/ --model=last
```

We can also run the COCO evaluation code with:
```
# Run COCO evaluation on the last trained model
python3 samples/coco.py evaluate --dataset=/path/to/coco/ --model=last
```

The training schedule, learning rate, and other parameters should be set in `samples/coco.py`.


# Training on our own Dataset

Start by reading this [blog post about the balloon color splash sample](https://engineering.matterport.com/splash-of-color-instance-segmentation-with-mask-r-cnn-and-tensorflow-7c761e238b46). It covers the process starting from annotating images to training to using the results in a sample application.

In summary, to train the model on your own dataset you'll need to extend two classes:

```Config```
This class contains the default configuration. Subclass it and modify the attributes you need to change.

```Dataset```
This class provides a consistent way to work with any dataset. 
It allows you to use new datasets for training without having to change 
the code of the model. It also supports loading multiple datasets at the
same time, which is useful if the objects you want to detect are not 
all available in one dataset. 


## Requirements
Python 3.4, TensorFlow 1.3, Keras 2.0.8 and other common packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

### MS COCO Requirements:
To train or test on MS COCO, you'll also need:
* pycocotools (installation instructions below)
* [MS COCO Dataset](http://cocodataset.org/#home)
* Download the 5K [minival](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/o43o90bna78omob/instances_minival2014.json.zip?dl=0)
  and the 35K [validation-minus-minival](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/s3tw5zcg7395368/instances_valminusminival2014.json.zip?dl=0)
  subsets. More details in the original [Faster R-CNN implementation](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn/blob/master/data/README.md).

If you use Docker, the code has been verified to work on
[this Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/waleedka/modern-deep-learning/).


## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run setup from the repository root directory
    ```bash
    python3 setup.py install
    ``` 
3. Download pre-trained COCO weights (mask_rcnn_coco.h5) from the [releases page](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases).
4. (Optional) To train or test on MS COCO install `pycocotools` from one of these repos. They are forks of the original pycocotools with fixes for Python3 and Windows (the official repo doesn't seem to be active anymore).

    * Linux: https://github.com/waleedka/coco
    * Windows: https://github.com/philferriere/cocoapi.
    You must have the Visual C++ 2015 build tools on your path (see the repo for additional details)
